### An Android Project basic structure & general knowledge
- 'java' folder contains the main code for the app (i.e, the Activity , v..v)
- 'res' folder holds resources - static contents used in the apps, including images, text strings, screen layouts, styles, and values such as hexadecimal colors or standard dimensions.
- 'manifests' folder contains files that provide essential info about your app to the Android system. (e.g the AndroidManifest.xml)
- 'Gradle Scripts': Gradle is a build automation system that describes the app's PROJECT STRUCTURE, CONFIG. & DEPENDENCIES
  + ' build.gradle(Project: ...)' : <project-level> contains the config. options that are common to all the modules that make up your project. Every Android project contains a single, top-level Gradle build file. This file defines the Gradle repositories and dependencies that are COMMON TO ALL MODULES in the project.
  + 'build.gradle(Module:app)' : <module-level> Each module has a build.gradle file of its own. The module-level build.gradle file allows you to configure build settings for each module. You may need to edit this build.gradle file when you change the SDK level that your app supports, or when you declare new dependencies in the dependencies section...
